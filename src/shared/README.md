# Shared Module

These are atomic and molecular level dumb components which are shared across the app, styles are also included here.

Rules -

1. Cannot make any api calls here.
2. Building blocks level components only that does not directly relate to any app related feature.
3. Eg - Button, Text, Input, Modal etc.
4. NEVER import other modules from the app here, this directory is standlone, so much that it could be taken out of this web app repo.
